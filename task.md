# Data Science Intern Assignment
This assignment is designed to assess how you approach solving a problem using real-world data. It
is not just a coding challenge but an opportunity to showcase how you think, structure an analysis,
and communicate insights. You can choose between two tracks based on your interests and skills:
## Option 1: Solve a Real-World Problem Using LLMs
Use a large language model (LLM) to solve a real-world problem. You can explore areas like for
example:
• Text classification & NLP – Sentiment analysis, fake news detection, document
summarization.
• Data augmentation & enhancement – Generating synthetic data, filling in missing
information.
• Automation & code generation – AI-powered SQL query generation, chatbot development.
• Decision support & recommendations – Personalized career advice, financial report
insights.
## Deliverables
• A github repo
• A Jupyter Notebook (or similar) with your analysis, code, and results.
• A short write-up explaining your approach, challenges, and key takeaways.
• If applicable, showcase how your LLM approach compares to traditional methods.

## Guidelines
• Your project should be a proof of concept (PoC) rather than a perfect end-to-end solution.
• Focus on the process, insights, and reasoning rather than just the final model.
• Visualize your findings and discuss challenges, pitfalls, and potential improvements.
• Treat it as an opportunity to showcase your thinking, creativity, and problem-solving
skills.
